a little list 3/25/24

goals for ratan :D
THE GRIND NEVER STOPS!!!
print out infantry pieces (12 total)
cut out cardboard(dimensions: ) liqud nails(glue)
start off with 2 players for now(red + blue)
basic mechanism for lights 
(already built)
game play:
each person takes turns putting down soldiers on map
each turn, you can take any unit and move it one spot to neighboring country
or
//attack:
press button, lcd screen shows score for each, then says who won, led shines for player (1/2)
first roll to decide order of players
(choose to move or not)
if a country if occupied, you must attack to take over country

: attack ends when ones side runs out of pieces

idea(._.)

# pad will select wich country to light up
each country will have a number designated to it
in the beggining, it will stay nothing color. If you want to change it, press(A = red or B = blue)
'C' = clear if you abandon country
